# Surprise Housing Assignment
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

Recommendations for Business

Investigaing in properties with Basement.
Locatality preference should be Crawford & Somerst
Property overall size should high so if Garage is not there, business can provision it to increase prices.
Properties with Overall Quality rating between Fair(3) to (7) should be considered. Because with repair\renovation work, property prices can be increased.
